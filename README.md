# Data-X-Project: Predicting Treatment Completion of People with Depression
The goal of this project is to use a dense neural network (DNN) to accurately predict whether or not a patient diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will complete their treatment based on variables from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R).
